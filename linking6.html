      <p>The Ibrahim Rouza was constructed in 1626 CE by Ibrahim Adil Shah II, the sixth Sultan of Adil Shahi dynasty. It stands as a beautiful and picturesque group of two buildings which include the tomb of Ibrahim II, his queen Taj Sultana and four other members of the family.
The magnificent group stands upon a high terrace in a rectangular enclosure about 400 ft. square with a lofty entrance tower in the middle of the north wall, ornamented with four graceful minarets. The tomb which is by far the most ornate building in Bijapur has a double row of arches forming two open colonnades. It is surmounted by a dome resting on a second square rising out of the flat roof of the building with its base ornamented by a number of small minarets.
The columns of this colonnade are curiously wrought from the springing of the arches in imitation of wood carving and the arches themselves are of a very quaint shape and are encrusted with carving in a beautiful variety of design. Enclosed by this inner colonnade, is the square chamber forming the tomb. The exterior wall of the sepulcher is most elaborately decorated. To each of the four sides is a doorway flanked by an exquisite ornamental window with interlaced Arabic script. But the most remarkable feature is the hanging ceiling. It is composed of stone slabs with no apparent means of support, the secret lying in the exceptional tenacity of the mortar. Above is another chamber in the dome, reached by a narrow staircase. Over the north door is a Persian inscription, including a chronogram of 1626 CE. Over the south door is the date 1633 CE, with an inscription praising Ibrahim and another commemorating the architect. .</p>
